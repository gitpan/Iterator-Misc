Iterator::Misc version 0.03
===========================

This module provides various miscellaneous iterator functions
which are not important enough to include in Iterator::Util.

An "iterator" is an object, represented as a code block that generates
the "next value" of a sequence, and generally implemented as a
closure. 

See the Iterator module for more information on Iterators.


DEVELOPMENT STATE

This is a brand-new module.  It has a decent test suite, but has
not been extensively field-tested.  Therefore, it should be considered
"beta" software, and used with care.

If you find any bugs, or if any behavior of Iterator surprises you,
I would be grateful if you could send me an email message about it.
Thanks.
